In Russian historiography, the period of the most intense purge, 1937\u20131938, is called Yezhovshchina (literally, \"Yezhov phenomenon\", commonly translated as \"times of Yezhov\" or \"doings of Yezhov\"), after Nikolai Yezhov, the head of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, who was executed a year after the purge.
