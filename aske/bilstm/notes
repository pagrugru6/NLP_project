just do whatever they're doing in https://nbviewer.org/github/coastalcph/nlp-course/blob/master/labs/notebooks_2024/lab_4.ipynb
And instead you have tags like "ANSWER" and "NOT-ANSWER"
Why does one use vim above emacs?



Questions for TA:
    Are we allowed to just translate every question to english in preprocessing?


Done:
    DONE: I'm not inputting the question to the model right now
    Doesn't make sense as we're doing binary sequence labelling: Compute BLEU score
    FIXED I WAS: I believe that I'm currently adding _NOT_IN_ANS tokens as padding
    (1) Clean git again. You've deleted the lstm atm.


Missing for BiLSTM:
    (1) Make it actually output the answer
    (2) I'm not considering when the question is unanswerable
            Maybe add a special token to denote no answer
    (3) Train every language
    (4) Move it to cluster and test it. Just use F1 score

In week 4, how do you input the question with the context? Just (question,
    context) as a tensor?
